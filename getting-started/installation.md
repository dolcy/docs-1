Installation
============

### Using Composer

The recommended way to install Nice is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Just run the 
`composer require` command in your project directory to install Nice:

```bash
composer require nice/framework:~1.0
```

This command will download and install Nice into the current directory.
