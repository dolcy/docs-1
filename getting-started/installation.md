Installation
============

### Using Composer

The recommended way to install Nice is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Just run the 
``composer require`` command in your project directory to install it:

```bash
composer require nice/framework:dev-master nikic/fast-route:dev-master
```

This command will download and install Nice into the current directory.
